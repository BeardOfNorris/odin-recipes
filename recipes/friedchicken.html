            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This crispy fried chicken recipe delivers golden, juicy perfection with a simple yet irresistible approach. Begin by marinating chicken drumsticks and thighs in a zesty buttermilk mixture spiced with paprika, garlic powder, and a hint of cayenne for a tender, flavorful bite. Coat the pieces in seasoned flour, then fry them in hot oil until the outside crisps up to a delicious crunch while locking in all the succulent juices. Serve hot with a side of tangy coleslaw or mashed potatoes for a comforting, crowd-pleasing meal that’s sure to satisfy.
